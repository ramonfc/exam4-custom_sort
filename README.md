Resolving the test<br> Class to contain the customSort method that receives as a parameter a vector of integers of even length, its job will be to return the ordered vector in the next way: <br>-The first half of the values must be sorted
ascending <br>-The second half of the values must be sorted descending<br><br>
## Example:<br>
Input: <br>
int [] vector = {0, 2, 1, 65, 66, 78, 12, 11, 90, 13};

<br>
Output:<br>
int [] sortedVector = {0, 1, 2, 65, 66, 90, 78, 13, 12, 11};
